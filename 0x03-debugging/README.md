# 0x03. C - Debugging
## Learning Objectives

    What is debugging
    What are some methods of debugging manually
    How to read the error messages
### Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about


## 0. Multiple mains
mandatory

In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

	File: 0-main.c, holberton.h

## 1. Like, comment, subscribe
mandatory

Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

    Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
    You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
	File: 1-main.c

## 2. 0 > 972?
mandatory

This program prints the largest of three integers.

	File: 2-largest_number.c, holberton.h

## 3. Leap year
mandatory

This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

	File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, holberton.h
